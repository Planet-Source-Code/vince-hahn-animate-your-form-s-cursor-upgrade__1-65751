## Animate Your Form's Cursor Upgrade


</div>

### Description

This code simplifies the code found at http://www.Planet-Source-Code.com/vb/scripts/ShowCode.asp?txtCodeId=24150&amp;lngWId=1 so that one can use a module and just pass a few arguements rather than clutter up your load and unload procedures, or however else you want to call the routines.
 
### More Info
 
Setting: Calling form's name, or the "Me" thingy will do fine, and location of the animated cursor file (*.ani). In this case the location has been set up for whomever downloads it, but easy to follow.

Always be sure to unload via the form rather than the run/pause/stop buttons in VB, and call the routines in the unload and load events

You may like it too much. I know I do.
